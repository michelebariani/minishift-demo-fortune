# minishift-demo-fortune
A simple and silly application to be used in a Minishift demo, in progressive stages:

* Stage 1 : The native Docker way

* Stage 2 : Build Docker images that can run in Openshift (uid constraints)

* Stage 3 : Add YAML Manifest files, and use them

* Stage 4 : Add a second (consumer) application, and exploit a base image
